# lemonade-pi-plugin

Pi.dev extension that registers [Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) — a local LLM server with GPU/NPU acceleration — as a custom provider in Pi.

After install, type `/login` in Pi, pick **Lemonade** from the OAuth selector, confirm or override the server URL, optionally enter an API key, then all models exposed by your server are registered automatically.

## Features

- **Built-in `/login` integration** — appears as a "Lemonade" choice in Pi's OAuth selector. No custom slash commands needed.
- **UDP beacon discovery** — listens for Lemonade's broadcast on port `13305` (the same channel `lemonade scan` uses) and finds local *and* LAN servers automatically.
- **HTTP fallback** — scans `localhost:13305`, `8000`, `1234`, `9000`, `8080` if no beacon arrives.
- **API key support** — prompted during login, stored by Pi in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` on every request.
- **Model admin** — `/lemonade` for status, health, list, models, load, unload, pull, delete, refresh, discover, change-ctx.

## Install

### Via Pi (git)

```bash
pi install git:github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade-pi-plugin@main
```

### Local (development)

Symlink the repo into Pi's extension directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade-pi-plugin.git
cd lemonade-pi-plugin
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer creates `~/.pi/agent/extensions/lemonade-provider` as a symlink to the repo.

## Usage

1. Make sure a Lemonade server is running somewhere reachable. On the same machine: `lemond` (defaults to port 13305). On the LAN: any host already running `lemond` will be discovered automatically.
2. Start Pi: `pi`
3. Type `/login` → pick **Lemonade** from the selector.
4. The extension prompts you in order:
   - **Server selection** — if one server was found, press Enter to accept; if multiple, type the number; if none, type a URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`).
   - **API key** — **Do not leave this blank.** Enter a dummy value (e.g., `lemonade`) or paste your actual key. Even if your local server does not enforce authentication, the underlying Pi client wrapper requires a non-empty string to pass its internal validation rules.
5. After verification, the extension registers every model the server reports, and it appears in Pi's model picker under "Lemonade".

### Discovery details

Lemonade broadcasts a JSON beacon every ~1s on UDP `13305`:
```json
{"service":"lemonade","hostname":"my-host","url":"http://192.168.1.5:13305/api/v1/"}
```
The extension binds to `0.0.0.0:13305` with `SO_REUSEADDR` (so it coexists with `lemonade scan` running in parallel) and listens for ~2.5 seconds during login. Both loopback and LAN broadcasts are captured.

## Admin command: `/lemonade`

Once logged in, you can manage the connected server without leaving Pi:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/lemonade status` | Server health: version, currently loaded model, all loaded models, WebSocket port |
| `/lemonade health` | Server health (rich): detailed display with backend info, recipe options, model limits |
| `/lemonade models` / `list` | List every model the server knows about, with size, recipe, and context window |
| `/lemonade load <id>` | Load a model into memory (`POST /api/v1/load`) |
| `/lemonade unload [id]` | Unload one model, or all loaded models if no id |
| `/lemonade pull <id>` | Download a model (`POST /api/v1/pull`) |
| `/lemonade delete <id>` | Delete a model from disk (`POST /api/v1/delete`) |
| `/lemonade refresh` | Re-fetch the model list and re-register the provider in Pi |
| `/lemonade discover` | Print every Lemonade server visible via beacon + HTTP scan |
| `/lemonade change-ctx <ctx_size> [model]` | Change context size for a loaded model (supports `32k`, `64k`, `1m`, etc.) |
| `/lemonade tune <id>` | Probe a model's real capabilities (thinking, vision) against the running server, fetch the checkpoint's embedded GGUF sampling metadata, and write a provenance-tracked entry to the per-model catalog |

## Per-model catalog

Model capabilities and tuning parameters are driven by a per-model catalog —
no name heuristics. Models with a catalog entry get exactly what is written;
models without an entry get plain upstream behavior (no capability changes,
no parameter injection).

Two tiers, merged per model id (user tier wins field-by-field):

1. **User tier** — `~/.pi/agent/model-params.json` (override the path with
   `LEMONADE_PARAMS_FILE`). Optional. Recognized models (present in
   [`examples/model-params.example.json`](examples/model-params.example.json))
   are seeded here **on first use, one model at a time** — the model of the
   request is the only reliable "current model" signal, so seeding follows
   what you actually run, never a bulk preload. Other models are created
   with `/lemonade tune <id>` (probes the running server) or by hand.
   Unknown models (neither tier) keep sane defaults: recipe-keyword
   reasoning detection in model sync, plain pi pass-through for tuning —
   nothing is invented.
2. **Plugin tier** — `lib/model-params.json` in this package (empty by
design — shipped entries live in
   [`examples/model-params.example.json`](examples/model-params.example.json)
   for reference). A first-use seed also refreshes `models-store.json`
   (debounced) so the seeded model's reasoning flag — and therefore its
   available thinking levels — apply without a pi restart.

`/lemonade tune <id>` writes only what it sourced or proved: probe results
for `reasoning`/`vision`, and the checkpoint's embedded
`general.sampling.*` values (read from the GGUF file via its HuggingFace
pointer) for the sampling row. Every written field is recorded in an
`_meta` provenance block; anything else (budgets, response ceiling,
off-switch params) stays unset until you add it — unset fields mean
"server defaults stand".

See the example file for the full entry schema (partial rows allowed).

## How it works

The extension registers a Pi provider named `lemonade` with an `oauth` block:
- `oauth.name = "Lemonade"` — what shows in `/login`.
- `oauth.login(callbacks)` — runs the discovery + prompt flow above.
- `oauth.refreshToken(creds)` — re-fetches the model list and re-registers the provider, so newly pulled models show up after a Pi reload without re-running `/login`.
- `oauth.getApiKey(creds)` — returns the stored API key for the `Authorization: Bearer …` header.

The connection details (`baseUrl`, `apiKey`, `serverName`) are encoded as JSON in the OAuth `refresh` field. Pi handles persistence in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

The Pi-side API call goes through Lemonade's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. The extension uses `api: "openai-completions"` in the provider config.

`pi.extensions` in `package.json` tells Pi which file to load. No build step required — Pi loads `.ts` directly via [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti).

## Troubleshooting

**"Lemonade" doesn't appear in /login.** Restart Pi (or `/reload`). Confirm the symlink exists: `ls -la ~/.pi/agent/extensions/lemonade-provider`.

**No servers discovered.** Confirm `lemond` is running: `curl http://localhost:13305/api/v1/health`. Confirm port 13305 isn't blocked by a local firewall (UDP). The HTTP fallback should still find a localhost server even if the beacon is blocked.

**Models don't appear in the picker after login.** Run `/lemonade refresh`. If still empty, check `/lemonade models` — if the server reports models there but Pi doesn't show them, your provider model list might be stale; a full Pi restart will re-trigger the OAuth refresh.

**API key isn't being sent.** Re-run `/login` and pick Lemonade again, paste the key when prompted. Verify with `/lemonade status` — if it returns 401, the key is wrong; if it returns the server health, you're authenticated.
